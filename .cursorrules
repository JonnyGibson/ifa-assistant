# .cursorrules - AI Development Guidelines
consult the readme.md file to check the current tech stack and goals.
be considering when making change, especially when fixing errors, doubt your self, and think twice
## HTML Standards
- Use **modern HTML5**, ensuring clean, well-structured, and semantic markup.
- Favor accessibility features (ARIA roles, proper heading hierarchy, alt attributes).
- Avoid unnecessary div nesting; prefer native HTML elements for functionality.

## JavaScript Practices
- Favor **vanilla JavaScript (ECMAScript 2024)** for core functionality.
- Use **npm packages only when essential**, avoiding bloated dependencies.
- Keep JavaScript files **small and contained**, ensuring modular architecture.
- Utilize **ES modules** for efficient code organization.
- Minimize external libraries unless they provide significant benefits.

## Backend Configuration
- Use **Node.js** and **npm** for backend logic and package management.
- Prefer **Supabase** for authentication and data storage. Remember we are using supabase, and not postresql, ensure we target supabase
- Utilize environment variables (`.env`) for sensitive credentials.

## Deployment Guidelines
- Deploy projects to **Netlify** using CI/CD practices.
- Include a `netlify.toml` configuration file for automated builds.
- Ensure optimized asset delivery and caching strategies.

## Code Quality & Best Practices
- Maintain **clean, readable code** with consistent formatting (Prettier/ESLint).
- Use `async/await` for handling asynchronous operations.
- Keep JavaScript logic **lightweight and efficient**, reducing file size.
- Prioritize performance optimizations, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

## Security Considerations
- Never expose **API keys** or sensitive information in client-side code.
- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Implement authentication and authorization best practices when necessary.

## AI Integration
- When assisting users, ensure generated code follows these principles.
- Provide recommendations based on modern development standards.
- Encourage best practices and efficient workflows.
